#### This project demonstrates how to create a responsive contact form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The contact form is designed to look good on desktop and mobile devices, and it gets data that users enter.

#### The HTML file includes the form structure, including input fields for Username, Email, Phone, and Message. 
#### The CSS file provides styling for the form elements, including media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. 
#### The JavaScript file handles form validation and displays error messages when the email address is not in a valid format.
